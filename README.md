# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using a breast cancer dataset. It automatically preprocesses data, trains a model, evaluates performance using key metrics, and saves the trained pipeline for future use, demonstrating a real-world production-ready ML workflow.
